/**
 * @param name: The name of the generated wrapper class. By default it will be called OriginalClassNameNative.
 * @param freeze: Whether to freeze the wrapper class, the SuspendWrapper/FlowWrapper and the job
 *      they produce. If freeze=false (default) then the wrapped class can be mutable. However if
 *      you want to pass the wrapper across threads, you need to have it frozen and that's when
 *      freeze=true comes in handy.
 * @param launchOnScope: The ScopeProvider which gives scope for launching the coroutines inside
 *      wrapper. Can be omitted, but then the scope needs to be passed directly to the wrapper
 *      inside iOS code. Providing it here deals with the inconvenience.
